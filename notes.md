# React framework

## Quick introduction: What is React and why would you want to use it?

- component-based framework
- widely adopted
- multi-device support
- write reusable components

## Hot spot 1: Components (inheritance) (+ composition?)

- first class component, then function
- basic structure: props, state, rerender on change of state/props

## Hot spot 2: custom hook

## Hot spot 3: HTML event handling (in TodoForm.tsx)

- 2-way data binding using `value` and `onChange`
